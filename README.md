# Note Taker
## Description
This is a simple Note Taker that allows users to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Functionality
When the note title and note text fields are entered, a save button appears on the top right of the screen. Clicking this button adds the note to the left of the page. Clicking the + button prompts an empty note for the user. Users can also click the trash icon to delete notes that are no longer needed.
